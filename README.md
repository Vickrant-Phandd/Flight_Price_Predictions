# Flight_Price_Predictions
I worked on this project because all independent features were of categorical type. To convert it into numerical values LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoding were required. Also, it is not compulsory that we have to do import sklearn all the time and do the conversion, One can manually put values without using libraries and I have done that too.
